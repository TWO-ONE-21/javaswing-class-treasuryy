# Local JARs (if not managed by Maven properly)
# The `lib` directory contains KControls-2.0.jar which is a local dependency.
# It's generally good practice to commit local dependencies if they are critical
# and not available elsewhere, but if you prefer not to commit large binaries,
# you can uncomment the line below. However, given the current setup, it's
# likely intended to be committed or managed manually.
